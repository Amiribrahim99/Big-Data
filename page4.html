        <h1>Characteristic of Big Data</h1>
        <p>It can be described as the following: <br><span>Volume:</span> The amount of data that is generated and stored. The data size defines the importance and possible insight, and whether or not it can be regarded as big data.<br><span>Variety:</span> Data type and character. That helps people who analyze it use the resulting insight effectively. Big data draws from text, images, audio, video; plus the missing pieces are completed by fusion of data.<br><span>Velocity:</span> The speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the growth and development path demands and challenges that lie. Big data can often be accessed in real time. Big data are produced more continually compared with small data. The frequency of generation and the frequency of handling, recording, and publishing are two kinds of velocity related to big data. <br><span>Veracity:</span>It is the extended definition for big data, which refers to the data quality and the data value. The data quality of captured data can vary greatly, affecting the accurate analysis.<br><span>Exhaustive: </span>Whether the entire system (i.e.n=all) is captured or recorded or not Fine-grained and uniquely lexical: Respectively, the proportion of specific data of each element per element collected and if the element and its characteristics are properly indexed or identified.<br><span>Relational:</span>If the data collected contains common fields that would enable a conjoining, or meta-analysis, of different data sets.</p>
