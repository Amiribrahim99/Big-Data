        <p>The term has been around since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term. Big data processing includes data sets of sizes beyond the capability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable lapse of time. Big data is a combination of structured, semi structured and unstructured data collected by organizations that can be mined for information and used in machine learning projects, predictive modeling and other advanced analytics applications. Big data requires a set of new types of integration techniques and technologies to reveal insights from diverse complex and massive data sets. A 2018 definition states 'Big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data,' and notes that 'this represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computing sciences used through parallel programming theories and the loss of some of the guarantees and capabilities of the Cod relational model.</p>
